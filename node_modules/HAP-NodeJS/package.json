  "readme": "HAP-NodeJS\n=============\nHAP-NodeJS is a Node.js implementation of HomeKit Accessory Server.\n\nWith this project, you should be able to create your own HomeKit Accessory on Raspberry Pi, Intel Edison or any other platform that can run Node.js :)\n\nThe implementation may not 100% follow the HAP MFi Specification since MFi program doesn't allow individual developer to join. \n\nRemember to run `npm install` before actually running the server.\n\nUsers can define their own accessories in: accessories/*name*_accessory.js files, where name is a short description of the accessory. All defined accessories get loaded on server start. The accessory is defined using an object literal notation.\n\nYou can use the following command to start the HAP Server:\n  ```js\n  node BridgedCore.js\n  ```\n\nSpecial thanks to [Alex Skalozub](https://twitter.com/pieceofsummer), who reverse engineered the server side HAP. ~~You can find his research at [here](https://gist.github.com/pieceofsummer/13272bf76ac1d6b58a30).~~ (Sadly, on Nov 4, Apple sent the [DMCA](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2014-11-04-Apple.md) request to Github to remove the research.)\n\n[There](http://instagram.com/p/t4cPlcDksQ/) is a video demo running this project on Intel Edison.\n\nIf you are interested in HAP over BTLE, you might want to check [this](https://gist.github.com/KhaosT/6ff09ba71d306d4c1079).",
